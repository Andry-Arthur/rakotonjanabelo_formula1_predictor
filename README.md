# Formula Junior Series Performance Analyzer  
*A predictive model to identify future Formula 1 talent using Formula 2 and Formula 3 data*  
**By Andry Rakotonjanabelo**

## Project Overview  
This repository contains two complementary Jupyter notebooks:  
1. **Prelim_EDA_Andry.ipynb** – an initial exploratory data analysis, downloading and inspecting raw F2/F3 data, summary statistics, and cross-series comparisons (wins, positions by team).  
2. **EDA_formula_2.ipynb** – a deeper dive into Formula 2:  
   - Feature engineering (time-to-seconds conversions, gap cleaning)  
   - Grouping by driver to compute aggregate metrics (total laps, average gap, speed, finish time, best lap)  
   - Labeling which drivers have “reached F1”  
   - Unsupervised clustering with a pure-NumPy KMeans (to avoid BLAS/threadpool issues)  
   - PCA projection and 2D/3D visualizations highlighting F1 graduates  
   - Quantitative cluster validation (Silhouette, Calinski–Harabasz, Davies–Bouldin) and cluster “purity” vs. F1 labels

## Key Features  
- **Data Ingestion**  
  - Download F2 race results via KaggleHub  
  - Read F3 team/driver tables from HTML  
- **Preliminary EDA**  
  - Dataset overview, `info()`/`describe()`, relational F1 dataset integration  
  - Barplots comparing F2 vs F3 wins, scatter of team performance across series  
- **Advanced EDA & Modeling**  
  - Time string parsing into seconds for `TIME` and `BEST` columns  
  - Cleaning of `GAP` field (DNF removal, “–” and “1 LAP” replacements)  
  - Aggregation by driver and joining with manual F1-graduation labels  
  - Custom NumPy KMeans clustering and PCA dimensionality reduction  
  - 2D scatter in PCA space and 3D feature‐combination plots, with F1 drivers highlighted  
  - Metrics to assess cluster quality and alignment with actual F1 promotions  

## Data Sources  
| Source | Description | Access Method |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| F2 Race Results (2018-2019) | Laps, times, gaps, speeds, pilot names, teams | KaggleHub CSV |
| F3 Teams & Drivers (2019) | Team, chassis, engine, drivers | HTML scrape via `pd.read_html` |
| F3 Driver Standings (2023) | Points, wins, podiums | KaggleHub CSV |

## How to Reproduce  
1. `pip install -r requirements.txt`  
2. Open and run **Prelim_EDA_Andry.ipynb** to see basic data checks and F2 vs F3 comparisons.  
3. Open **EDA_formula_2.ipynb** to step through feature engineering, clustering, PCA, visualizations, and clustering‐validation metrics.  

## Conclusions & Next Steps  
- Early EDA reveals distribution of wins and team performance across F2/F3.  
- Advanced EDA shows that consistent front-runners in F2 (Cluster 1) largely correspond to those who graduate to F1.  
- Clustering metrics are moderate—further feature engineering or a supervised model (e.g. logistic regression, random forest) could improve prediction of F1 promotions.  

## Artifacts  
- **f2_drivers_to_f1.csv** (generated by `EDA_formula_2.ipynb`):  
  Per-driver aggregates including total laps, avg gap, avg speed, avg finish position, time & best-lap in seconds, F1-graduation label and KMeans cluster.
