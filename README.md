# Formula Junior Series Performance Analyzer  
*A predictive model to identify future Formula 1 talent using Formula 2 and Formula 3 data*  
**By Andry Rakotonjanabelo & Md Nafisul Hasan Sami**

## Project Overview  
This machine learning project analyzes Formula 2 and Formula 3 performance data to predict which junior drivers are most likely to succeed in Formula 1. The model evaluates race results, qualifying performance, lap times, and career progression patterns.

## Key Features  
- **Data Pipeline**: Automated collection of F2/F3 results from official sources and third-party repositories  
- **Predictive Modeling**: Machine learning algorithms trained on historical driver progression data  
- **Performance Metrics**: Driver comparison tools and success probability estimations
